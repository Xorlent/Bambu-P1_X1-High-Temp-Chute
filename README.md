## Background
Some materials are notoriously sensitive to chamber temperature variations or require elevated chamber temperature for proper bed adhesion and to control warping.  This chute cover helps by reducing air drafts entering the chamber via the waste chute.
> [!NOTE]
> Bambu Labs advises against installing anything covering the waste chute, as it can cause issues with waste purge and possibly lead to nozzle clogs.  More info [here](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/general/bambu-mods-to-avoid)

## Printing

## Using
- Remove the two screws holding the back cover of the printer to the waste chute.
- Retrieve two 8MM long screws from the spare scraper baggie in the Bambu accessories box.
- Install the chute using the two 8mm screws being very careful not to overtighten.
- Carefully slide the cover door over the end of the chute.
- When printing most materials, you can snap the receptacle into the two receiving slits in the cover door.
  - Start with the bottom of the receptacle at a 45 degree angle from the printer, insert, and move the receptacle to an upright position.
