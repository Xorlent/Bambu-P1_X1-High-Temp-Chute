- Retrieve two 8MM long screws from the spare scraper baggie in the Bambu accessories box.
- Install the chute using the two 8mm screws being very careful not to overtighten.
- Carefully slide the cover door over the end of the chute.
- When printing most materials, you can snap the receptacle into the two receiving slits in the cover door.
  - Start with the bottom of the receptacle at a 45 degree angle from the printer, insert, and move the receptacle to an upright position.
